	<p>For the first project, students will ideate, design and develop a fully functional multi-page responsive website using a web design framework.</p>
<p><a href="#project-1a">Project 1A</a></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p><a href="../../assets/documents/Rubric-Project1.pdf">Evaluation Criteria</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Project 1 will focus on the theme of an event. Students will select an existing event that features:<ul>
<li>Multiple locations (i.e. stages, lecture halls/rooms, theatres, sporting venues, etc.)</li>
<li>Multiple presenters (i.e. artists, speakers, exhibitors, athletes, etc.)</li>
<li>Multiple time blocks (i.e. multiple concurrent sessions throughout a day, multiple days, etc.)</li>
<li>Some examples of suitable events include: TIFF, Nuit Blanche, Coachella, Pan American Games, DesignThinkers, Consumer Electronics Show (CES)</li>
<li>Some examples of events that are <strong>not</strong> suitable include: Taylor Swift concert, a comedy show, a wedding, a single speaker engagement</li>
<li><strong>The event must be approved by your instructor</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both the visual and the textual content of your site may come from existing sources, but must be attributed within the website. Design elements (i.e. visual language, icons, typography, etc.) must be developed by the student.</li>
<li>Your site should include a home page, as well as at least three additional unique pages (e.g. schedule, speakers/exhibitors/performers, location, etc.)</li>
<li>The end product will be a fully functional website developed using a web framework (such as <a href="http://flexboxgrid.com">Flexbox Grid</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be careful not to prioritize quantity over quality; building more pages than the requirement doesnâ€™t necessarily mean a better project/grade. Students are expected to produce quality layouts, be original, creative, and consistent with their visual language.</p>
